This repository demonstrates an uncommon coding error in Python where a ZeroDivisionError is masked by a conditional statement. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` will raise a ZeroDivisionError if the input 'a' is 0. This error is less common because the condition `a == 0` is very specific, and it would usually be checked before the division occurs. A more conventional error would be to divide by zero unintentionally, even if there is a conditional statement.

The solution demonstrates how to handle this error properly, preventing the program from crashing unexpectedly.
